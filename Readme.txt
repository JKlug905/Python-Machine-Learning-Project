This is the python file for my portion of my final project for my Statistics and Machine Learning in Python and R class.
The data set used is “Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set” and is obtained from the University of Wisconsin
Departements of Computer Science and Surgery, it is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

The goal of my project was to create several machine learning models to use the data collected to create a machine learning model
that could predict whether a tumor was benign or malignant using variables collected on cell measurements gained from a fine needle
aspirate biopsy. I created three models and compared them on measures of accuracy and ROC curve. For the random forest and GBC I plotted
a graph of the variables that made the greatest impact on the predictions. I also included some violin plots to show how those variables
were distributed and compared between the benign and malignant tumors.

I also included the segments I wrote for the paper in a PDF, where I explore other comparisons between the performance of the model using measures
such as F1 Score, Kappa, Sensitivity/Specificity etc.
